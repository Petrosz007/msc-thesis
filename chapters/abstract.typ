In this thesis I'll introduce my automatic test case generation algorithm, which uses General Predicate Testing proposed by Kovacs Attila and Forgacs Istvan @thebook. I'll outline the current state-of-the-art black box testing strategies, what their advantages and disadvantages are. I'll explain what GPT is, how it works in theory, and how I put it into practice. I'll show my proposed Domain Specific Language for formalizing the predicates of requirements. I'll show how this automatic test generation scales much better than the current state-of-the-art manual test generation techniques.
