- Quote The Book
- The Book p23-24, replicate this test
- Give example about the usage of GPT, what bugs it can catch
  - Heck, dedicate a whole chapter to it, it is important
- The Book p69 is about GPT @thebook[p. 69]


Matrix graph was tried out, but it had ~4 times worse performance. It is probably because we have to find edges in the graph for MONKE and the sparcer the matrix gets the harder that is.

Smaller sample:

Number of test cases: 250
Number of edges in initial graph: 2768

Least Losing Edges Reachable: 50
Runtime: 19.24s

MONKE: 49
Runtime: 12ms

- Murane argues that "One disadvantage with boundary value analysis is that it is not as systematic as other prescriptive testing techniques" @murnane2001effectiveness. GPT is systematic and test cases can be generated automatically

- Contrary to what Analyzing boundaries can't only be done on number types, but it can be extrapolated for other types as well. As Rabino has shown, it is possible to analyze boundary conditions of physical properties like wind speed or Reynolds Number for Turbulence models @rabino2018.
