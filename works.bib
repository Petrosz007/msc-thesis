  abstract = {In partition analysis we divide the input domain to form subdomains on which the system's behaviour should be uniform. Boundary value analysis produces test inputs near each subdomain's boundaries to find failures caused by incorrect implementation of the boundaries. However, boundary value analysis can be adversely affected by coincidental correctness---the system produces the expected output, but for the wrong reason. This article shows how boundary value analysis can be adapted in order to reduce the likelihood of coincidental correctness. The main contribution is to cases of automated test data generation in which we cannot rely on the expertise of a tester.},

	abstract = {The body of knowledge in the area of black-box unit testing is quite well established, e.g., the concepts of category partitioning, boundary value analysis, and pair-wise testing. However, tool support to apply the existing techniques in large-scale industrial software projects is fairly limited. Although tools such as HexaWise enable testers in automatic generation of all-combination pair-wise test input data, nevertheless converting them to actual test case source code (e.g., in NUnit) is both very tedious and also error prone. To address the above challenge, we have developed an open-source tool, referred to as AutoBBUT, for automated generation of black-box NUnit test cases for the C{\#} .Net platform. Evaluation of the tool in an industrial setting by using it to automatically generate more than 1,962 NUnit test cases (having 15,906 test line of code) in NUnit shows the effectiveness of the tool in saving testers a lot of time and also preventing unwanted defects and/or test smells in test code, which can occur due to manual test code development.},
